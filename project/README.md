## Description

This project aims to apply knowledge and techniques acquired in previous Computer Graphics classes to create an interactive 3D scene. The scene will incorporate several elements including terrain, flowers, rocks, a bee, and a hive. Each component will utilize various modeling, animation, and rendering techniques to demonstrate proficiency in these areas.

### Implemented Features
* Sphere creation and sky panorama 
* Modeling a flower with random parameterization and diversity in colors and textures
* Creating rocks and boulders with different sizes and structures
* Modeling a bee with animation and movement control (horizontal and vertical movement and option to reset bee's position)
* Creating a pollen (with option to drop it) and a modern hive
* Shaders and animation appplied eg. in the bee and the flowers
* Creating simple grass 
	
### Aditional features
* Multiple layers for the petals of the flowers
* Realistic sky with movement 
* Parabolic trajectory for the bee's movement 

### Keys
* W - Accelerate (horizontal movement)
* S - Drake (horizontal movement)
* A - Rotate bee to the left
* D - ROtate bee to the right
* R - Reset bee's position
* F - Descend (vertical movement)
* P - Ascend (vertical movement)
* O - Drop pollen
